# 2022 ABCD-ReproNim Course Project Month Proposals
Tracking and managing project proposals for the ABCD-ReproNim course's 2022 Project Month.

## Contributing

All individuals who have a valid data use certification (DUC) for the ABCD dataset are invited to participate in the ABCD-ReproNim course's Project Month (April 4-29, 2022). If you are interested you can [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9V3k-TF6EaQKdJ1eXC8BtOIRbJ2JPvcyrw-NFjPxYk6wAGA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

To propose a project, you can open an issue with the "Propose project" template or [click here](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/2022_Project_Month/issues/new/choose).
There will be instructions for filling out the template.
Don't worry about having a fully fleshed-out analysis plan - the project proposal issues are for _initial_ plans.

If you find yourself overwhelmed by the template, please look at [our example proposal](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/2022_Project_Month/issues/2).

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your ideas. No, really. Project proposals can always be tuned and improved over time, so please feel free to open an issue for your idea.

## Where are the existing project proposals?

The projects that have already been proposed can be viewed on [the Issues page](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/2022_Project_Month/issues). Feel free to comment on any projects you're interested in! Project from last year can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues)
