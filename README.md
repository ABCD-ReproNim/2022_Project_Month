# 2022 ABCD-ReproNim Course Project Month Proposals
Tracking and managing project proposals for the ABCD-ReproNim course's 2022 Project Month.

## Contributing

The ABCD-ReproNim course's Project Month is limited to students with a valid data use certification (DUC) for the ABCD dataset.

However, you can propose a project long before the Project Month, and even before you have a DUC, as long as you are an ABCD-ReproNim student who has completed at least 70% of the Main 12-week Course or at least 80% of the AI/ML Course.

To propose a project, open an issue with the "Propose project" template or [click here](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues/new/choose).
There will be instructions for filling out the template.
Don't worry about having a fully fleshed-out analysis plan or anything- the project proposal issues are for _initial_ plans.

If you find yourself overwhelmed by the template, please look at [our example proposal](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues/2).

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**: We want your ideas. No, really. Project proposals can always be tuned and improved over time, so please feel free to open an issue for your idea.

## Where are the existing project proposals?

The projects that have already been proposed can be viewed on [the Issues page](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues). Feel free to comment on any projects you're interested in! Project from last year can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/projects/issues)

## Code of Conduct

We want all students to feel welcome when participating in conversations.
